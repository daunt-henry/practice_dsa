/*
 * LeetCode 815: Bus Routes
 *
 * Given a series of bus routes (loops of stops), find the minimum number
 * of buses required to travel from a source stop to a target stop.
 * If source == target, return 0.
 *
 * Approach:
 * 1. Map each stop to the buses that serve it.
 * 2. Perform BFS starting from source stop:
 *    - At each stop, for each bus serving it (not yet taken),
 *      board the bus (increment count), and enqueue all its stops.
 * 3. Stop when you reach 'target', returning the number of buses taken.
 *
 * Time Complexity: O(sum of all routes lengths)
 * Space Complexity: O(sum of all routes lengths)

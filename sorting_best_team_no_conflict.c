/*
Best Team With No Conflicts

Problem:
Form a team with players such that no younger player has a strictly higher score than an older player.
Return the maximum total score of such a team.

Approach:
1. Pair each player's age and score.
2. Sort players by age, breaking ties with score.
3. Use DP (similar to LIS) where dp[i] is the best score ending with player i.
4. A valid previous player j must have score[j] â‰¤ score[i].

Time Complexity: O(n^2)
Space Complexity: O(n)

Example:
Input: scores = [1,3,5,10,15], ages = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 34

/*
Problem: Most Common Word

Given a paragraph and a list of banned words, return the most frequent word that is not banned. 
It is guaranteed there is at least one word that isnâ€™t banned, and that the answer is unique.

Example:
Input: 
paragraph = "Bob hit a ball, the hit BALL flew far after it was hit."
banned = ["hit"]
Output: "ball"

Explanation: 
"hit" occurs 3 times but it is banned.
"ball" occurs 2 times (the most among the remaining words), so it is the answer.

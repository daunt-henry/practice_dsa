/*
Maximum Number of Coins You Can Get

Problem:
- You are given 3n piles of coins.
- You will pick n piles using the following rule:
  - You and your friend pick alternately, and you always pick the second-largest.
- Return the maximum number of coins you can collect.

Approach:
- Sort the array.
- Always pick the second-largest from the remaining 3 each time.
- Start from index n to 3n, picking every second element.

Time: O(n log n)
Space: O(1)

Example:
Input: piles = [2,4,1,2,7,8]
Sorted:        [1,2,2,4,7,8]
Alice picks:        2, 4 (index 2, 4) â†’ total = 6
Output: 9
